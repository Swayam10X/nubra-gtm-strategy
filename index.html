            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>Our vision is to position Nubra as the default platform for every engineer in the country to begin their trading and investing journey. This GTM strategy outlines a 1-year plan to capture a serviceable market of 36,000 activated trading accounts by focusing on an API-first product, targeted marketing, and strong community engagement.
Total Addressable Market (TAM)
Represents the total market demand for a product or service, signifying the theoretical upper ceiling of the opportunity.

Defines the maximum potential revenue if a business were to capture 100% of the market share.

Used to illustrate the ultimate scale and long-term potential of a market segment.

Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
The segment of the TAM that a company can realistically target with its current business model, products, and geographical reach.

Defines the specific portion of the total market that the business is equipped to serve.

This metric effectively narrows the market from the theoretical total to a practical target area.

Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
The portion of the SAM that a business can realistically capture in the short term, typically within 1-3 years.

Represents the concrete, near-term sales or user acquisition goal that a go-to-market strategy is designed to achieve.

This figure is determined by considering internal resources, budget, and the existing competitive landscape.
